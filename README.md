<h3>WebDev Final Project Description</h3>

<b>Pain Point / Problem:</b>
When looking for a place to eat, it isn't enough to know if the restauraunt overall is good. Perhaps you have specific dietary restrictions and you do not want to have to sift through long lists of options and have to dig deep to find out if they can accomodate you. You might want to have specific information about what dishes they offer and how good just that dish is. Therefore, this web application is focused on individual foods, not restaurants overall. 

<b>Two users that would use our web application:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Restaurant Management Representative:
    <ol>
      <li>Access and review feedback from users focused on particular aspects of food including quality, taste, how that dish can be adjusted to accomodate dietary restrictions, etc.</li>
      <li>Contact and communicate with users to answer food inquiries directed at the restaurant.</li>
  </li></ol>
  <li>Regular/Average customers:
    <ol>
      <li>Search for specific meals to find restaurants that can prepare those meals, view reviews, ratings, and delivery options for those specific meals, and be able to like or rate them.</li>
      <li>Create a custom profile containing information on dietary restrictions, preferences, favorite meals, reviews and ratings, to help with search.</li></ol>
   </li></ul>
    
<b>Overall Strategy:</b>
By designing a food reviewing service around specific dishes, customers can more easily find food they like and get a better idea of what to expect when ordering at a resrauant. They can also add their own ratings and review, and bookmark their favorite meals if they want to refer back to them. As stated above, this app will focus more on food and less on overall restaurant ratings. 

Customers can also have their own profile where they can add their dietary restrictions and preferences, which can help with filtering the search results and reviews.

<b>Web API:</b>
SinglePlatform is "the world's leading provider of menus" and has a free API that enables publishers to implement hundreds of thousands of restaurant menus spanning over 13,000 cities. This API has a vast amount of detailed information including price, delivery options, and dietary restrictions. Access to dietary restrictions get as detailed as including attributes to query if a menu object is organic, contains shellfish, soy, tree nuts, and more.
